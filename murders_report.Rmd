## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Murders summary}
summary(murders)
```
```{r, echo=F}
n <- nrow(murders)

```
There are `r n` records in murders dataset


```{r Head of data}
head(murders)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width=0.5, stat='identity', color='grey') +
  coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Histogram of Murder Rate
Check out the distribution of murder rate
```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}
hist(murders$rate)

```
